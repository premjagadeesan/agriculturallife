"India is an agricultural country" is a statement often seen in books that talk of our country, and it is to be realized that India will forever be an agricultural country. Further, as Mahatma Gandhi has aptly put it, the statement, "The future of India lives in its villages", stands true even today, in spite of the rapid urbanization taking place in our country.<br><br>
Hence, it is only wise to pay attention to agriculture, the main occupation of India. In this regard, the best step that can be taken now, is to provide a medium for people involved in this occupation to relate with each other through, get together and discuss topics of common interest.<br><br>

Agricultural Life (AL) is a website which tries to achieve precisely this objective. This website is dedicated entirely to the agricultural community.<br><br>
It provides a platform to exchange ideas, discuss and learn modern agricultural techniques, purchase tools for agriculture and to market crops, vegetables and fruits in India.<br><br>

AL attempts to reach out directly to the farmers, to acquaint them with wholesale and retail prices for crops and to provide a platform for them to learn and discuss novel farming techniques.<br><br>
